# Best Buy Objection Playbook

**Mode:** Calm, factual, non-defensive  
**Rule:** If evidence is incomplete, label as `HYPOTHESIS` and convert into pilot test criteria.
**Evidence tags:** Use the shared registry in `bestbuy_talk_track.md`.

## Objection 1
`objection`: "We already have recycling partners. Why add this?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "We are not replacing your partners. This is a bounded traceability and compliance extension to improve post-collection visibility."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "Your current ecosystem remains intact. The pilot is scoped to one store and specific categories so you can evaluate additional control and reporting without operational disruption. If value is not proven, the pilot stops cleanly."  
`evidence_required`: `E-02`, `E-04`  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 2
`objection`: "Is this legally safe?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Our operating rule is evidence-first: no unsourced legal claim is treated as fact, and hazardous Grade X items stay in Canada."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "We separate verified controls from legal hypotheses requiring citation. Compliance claims that still need section-level citations are flagged before execution, not hidden. This reduces legal overstatement risk."  
`evidence_required`: `E-03`, `E-08`, `H-01`  
`owner`: Ian

## Objection 3
`objection`: "Where is proof that this will work financially?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Financial projections are treated as `HYPOTHESIS` until pilot discovery data is available."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "We are not asking you to accept unsourced economics. We are asking for a controlled pilot that generates decision-grade data: actual mix, cycle time, exception rates, and validated unit economics."  
`evidence_required`: `H-02`, `E-05`  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 4
`objection`: "Could this create reputational risk for Best Buy?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "The model is designed to lower reputational risk through auditable controls, explicit boundaries, and stop conditions."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "The highest-risk class, Grade X, is explicitly retained in Canada. Pilot operations are documented with chain-of-custody checkpoints and transparent reporting. This creates verifiable governance rather than informal handling."  
`evidence_required`: `E-03`, `E-04`  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 5
`objection`: "This sounds like extra operational burden."  
`short_answer_20s`: "Pilot burden is intentionally narrow: one store, limited categories, and defined counterpart owners."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "We use a bounded pilot to avoid broad process change. The request is targeted data and access, not enterprise-wide transformation. Workload is controlled by scope and checkpoint-based governance."  
`evidence_required`: `E-04`, `E-05`  
`owner`: Retail Ops counterpart + Sivan

## Objection 6
`objection`: "What data do you need, and is data security addressed?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "We request minimal operational data required for pilot design and reporting; security controls are documented before execution."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "Initial request is limited to categories, rough volume, and point-of-contact process data. Security-sensitive handling and data destruction controls are part of the control package, and unresolved controls are marked as pre-launch requirements."  
`evidence_required`: `E-05`, `H-01`  
`owner`: Sivan + Compliance/Data counterpart

## Objection 7
`objection`: "Why start with one store instead of scaling immediately?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "One store reduces risk, speeds learning, and produces credible evidence before expansion."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "A constrained pilot lets both teams validate controls, reporting quality, and exception handling under real conditions. Scale decisions are stronger after operational evidence, not before."  
`evidence_required`: `E-04`  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 8
`objection`: "What if the pilot fails?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Failure is contained by design through stop/go gates and predefined boundaries."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "Pilot success criteria and stop conditions are defined upfront. If criteria are not met, the pilot ends without requiring broad process rollback because no enterprise-scale dependency is created."  
`evidence_required`: `E-04`  
`owner`: Sivan + Best Buy sponsor

## Objection 9
`objection`: "Why should we trust the team to execute this?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Execution ownership is role-defined across liaison, operations, and compliance functions."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "The presentation maps responsibilities clearly: stakeholder liaison, operations lead, and regulatory lead. Governance is explicit so accountability is auditable instead of personality-driven."  
`evidence_required`: `E-07`  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 10
`objection`: "We cannot commit today."  
`short_answer_20s`: "Today’s ask is not pilot approval; it is a formal decision meeting with named owners and a small discovery data packet."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "This is a low-friction next step. A follow-up decision meeting within 7 business days gives your team time to review internally while keeping momentum and accountability."  
`evidence_required`: `E-05`, `E-06`  
`owner`: Best Buy sponsor

## Objection 11
`objection`: "Can you summarize this in 15 minutes?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Yes. We use a compressed path focused on risk framing, pilot boundaries, controls, give/get, and commitment."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "If time is cut, we present slides 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 only. That preserves the decision logic without forcing unsourced detail."  
`evidence_required`: `bestbuy_talk_track.md` fallback section  
`owner`: Sivan

## Objection 12
`objection`: "Why now?"  
`short_answer_20s`: "Delay extends uncertainty. A bounded pilot converts uncertainty into evidence with controlled exposure."  
`deep_answer_90s`: "The program is structured to generate decision-grade facts quickly while keeping scope narrow and reversible. The result is better governance and clearer options, regardless of scale outcome."  
`evidence_required`: `E-04`, `E-08`  
`owner`: Sivan
