# Project eRecycle - Evidence-First Gist (Best Buy)

**As of:** February 18, 2026  
**Audience:** Green Team, Retail Operations, Compliance/Legal or Finance  
**Single ask:** 30-minute decision meeting to approve or decline a bounded pilot design review.

## What Is True Today (Verified Facts)

1. Basel e-waste amendments entered into force on **January 1, 2025** and expanded control scope for transboundary e-waste movements through PIC, including entries **A1181** (Annex VIII) and **Y49** (Annex II).
2. Ontario RPRA latest electronics metrics (page updated **January 30, 2026**) show:
- Recovery rate requirement: **65%**
- Actual recovery rate: **66%**
- Actual tonnes recovered: **41,579**
3. Best Buy Canada states environmental goals to reduce operational emissions by **75%** (vs. 2009 baseline) and be carbon neutral by **2040**, and to reduce customer emissions by **20% by 2030** (vs. 2017 baseline).
4. Best Buy Canada recycling policy states customers should remove personal data before recycling, Geek Squad support may involve charges, and Best Buy is not liable for data left on devices.
5. Canada cross-border hazardous waste/recyclable movement rules state that exporters/importers must submit a permit application to ECCC **prior to shipping** when controlled materials are in scope.

## Why This Matters for Best Buy Now

- Regulatory controls are active, and documentation quality directly affects compliance confidence.
- Best Buy already has strong sustainability commitments; decision-grade traceability data strengthens reporting credibility.
- A bounded pilot can generate evidence without changing enterprise operations.

## Current Gap We Can Address

- Customers and stakeholders need clearer item-level traceability after drop-off.
- Current process language focuses on safe recycling, but management-level evidence needs item-level documentation for decision-making.
- This proposal addresses documentation and audit-readiness, not partner replacement.

## Pilot Proposal (Bounded, Reversible)

- Scope: **1 Ottawa-area store**, **3 months**, **limited categories** (initially laptops/desktops).
- Operating model: parallel pilot, not a replacement of current recycling partners.
- Control gates:
1. Pre-launch evidence gate (all legal/process assumptions labeled VERIFIED or HYPOTHESIS).
2. Weekly risk review gate (exceptions and documentation completeness).
3. Stop condition gate (pause pilot if control breach is detected).

## Decision Data We Will Produce

1. Documentation completeness rate (items with full required records / total items).
2. Chain-of-custody coverage (items with full handoff trail / total items).
3. Grade distribution including Grade X containment in Canada.
4. Exception log and closure time.
5. Cycle-time visibility from drop-off to final documented disposition.

## Known Unknowns (Hypotheses, Not Claims)

1. Nigeria-side section-level legal citations for each operational step are pending citation packaging.
2. Store-level financial upside ranges are hypotheses until pilot discovery data is collected.
3. Final category scope may change after joint Green Team + Ops + Compliance/Legal review.
