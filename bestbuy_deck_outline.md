## Slide 1
`slide_number`: 1  
`title`: Decision Ask and Meeting Objective  
`management_question_answered`: What decision are you asking us to make today?  
`core_visual`: One-slide decision box with 3 asks: follow-up decision meeting, named owners, pilot discovery data.  
`speaker_note`: Open with "low-risk compliance and traceability pilot" framing. Confirm this is not a partner replacement model (`E-02`).  
`decision_signal`: Sponsor agrees to proceed through the deck against this decision frame.

## Slide 2
`slide_number`: 2  
`title`: Current Risk and Visibility Gap  
`management_question_answered`: What management problem are we solving?  
`core_visual`: Current-state map with one highlighted blind spot after item collection.  
`speaker_note`: Focus on control and traceability gap, not disruption narrative. Keep language operational and non-accusatory.  
`decision_signal`: Audience confirms this problem statement is materially relevant.

## Slide 3
`slide_number`: 3  
`title`: Compliance Reality and Evidence Discipline  
`management_question_answered`: How are legal/compliance risks being handled?  
`core_visual`: Two-column control model: `Verified control` vs `HYPOTHESIS pending citation`.  
`speaker_note`: State that unsourced legal claims are not being presented as facts (`E-08`). "Grade X stays in Canada" is non-negotiable (`E-03`).  
`decision_signal`: Compliance stakeholder agrees with evidence-first method and requests citation pack timing.

## Slide 4
`slide_number`: 4  
`title`: Controlled Pilot Design  
`management_question_answered`: What exactly is the pilot and how bounded is it?  
`core_visual`: Pilot boundary card: one store, three months, specific categories, stop/go gates.  
`speaker_note`: Keep scope intentionally narrow to lower exposure (`E-04`).  
`decision_signal`: Ops stakeholder agrees pilot boundary is operationally feasible.

## Slide 5
`slide_number`: 5  
`title`: Item Flow and Chain of Custody  
`management_question_answered`: How do we maintain control from intake to final disposition?  
`core_visual`: End-to-end flowchart with audit checkpoints and hazardous diversion gate.  
`speaker_note`: Emphasize documented handoffs and retention of hazardous fraction in Canada (`E-03`).  
`decision_signal`: Audience accepts that auditability is designed into operations.

## Slide 6
`slide_number`: 6  
`title`: Risk Register and Control Owners  
`management_question_answered`: What could go wrong and who owns each control?  
`core_visual`: Risk heatmap with owner column: Legal, Ops, Data, Reputation.  
`speaker_note`: Pair every major risk with a named owner and a pre-defined stop condition.  
`decision_signal`: Best Buy names provisional counterparts for risk ownership.

## Slide 7
`slide_number`: 7  
`title`: Pilot KPI Dashboard  
`management_question_answered`: How will we know if this is working?  
`core_visual`: Weekly KPI template: compliance completeness, cycle-time visibility, exception log, disposition summary.  
`speaker_note`: Avoid unsourced performance promises. Present measurement framework first; financial ranges remain `HYPOTHESIS` until discovery data is shared.  
`decision_signal`: Finance/ops agree on top KPI definitions and weekly reporting format.

## Slide 8
`slide_number`: 8  
`title`: Team and Governance Credibility  
`management_question_answered`: Who is accountable for execution quality?  
`core_visual`: RACI-style org strip with Sivan (liaison), Abdullahi (operations), Ian (regulatory).  
`speaker_note`: Keep credentials factual and role-based (`E-07`).  
`decision_signal`: Stakeholders agree counterpart mapping is clear.

## Slide 9
`slide_number`: 9  
`title`: What Best Buy Gives and Gets  
`management_question_answered`: Is the exchange fair and practical?  
`core_visual`: Give/Get matrix: data and access inputs vs reporting and compliance outputs.  
`speaker_note`: Use existing project value framing (`E-05`, `E-06`) without adding new unsourced benefit claims.  
`decision_signal`: Sponsor confirms the exchange model is reasonable for next-step evaluation.

## Slide 10
`slide_number`: 10  
`title`: Pilot Boundaries and Non-Goals  
`management_question_answered`: What are we explicitly not doing in this phase?  
`core_visual`: In-scope vs out-of-scope table.  
`speaker_note`: Repeat "not replacing existing partners" and "bounded pilot only" (`E-02`, `E-04`).  
`decision_signal`: Compliance and ops agree on exclusions and no-go categories.

## Slide 11
`slide_number`: 11  
`title`: 30-60-90 Day Execution View  
`management_question_answered`: What happens immediately after approval?  
`core_visual`: Timeline with fixed date windows:  
Phase 1 (`Feb 18-Mar 20, 2026`) setup and owner alignment.  
Phase 2 (`Mar 21-Apr 19, 2026`) process dry run and data intake.  
Phase 3 (`Apr 20-May 19, 2026`) pilot evidence readout.  
`speaker_note`: Frame the first 90 days as evidence generation, not scale.  
`decision_signal`: Audience agrees timeline is realistic and assigns availability windows.

## Slide 12
`slide_number`: 12  
`title`: Commitment Close  
`management_question_answered`: What concrete commitment do you need before we end?  
`core_visual`: Final checklist with three blanks: meeting date, owners, data packet lead.  
`speaker_note`: Ask for a follow-up decision meeting within 7 business days and confirm minimum attendees.  
`decision_signal`: Date is set, stakeholders are named, and data request owner is confirmed in-room.
