# Project eRecycle -> Best Buy Decision Meeting Request (One-Pager)

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Requested meeting format:** 30-minute decision meeting + Q&A  
**Requested meeting window:** February 24-26, 2026  
**Purpose:** Confirm owners, timeline, and minimum pilot discovery data for a bounded compliance-and-traceability pilot.

## problem

Best Buy already has established recycling channels. The unresolved management need is post-collection visibility and controlled traceability for a narrowly scoped pilot pathway.  
This request does not propose replacing current partners. It proposes a low-risk extension with explicit boundaries and audit checkpoints.

## proposal

Project eRecycle proposes a compliance-first pilot designed to generate decision-grade evidence before any scale decision.

- Pilot model: one store, three months, specific categories only.
- Operating posture: evidence-first, no unsourced claim presented as fact.
- Decision posture: reversible pilot with stop/go gates and named owners.

## pilot_boundary

In scope:
1. One Ottawa-area store.
2. Three-month pilot cycle.
3. Limited categories approved by Best Buy stakeholders.
4. Weekly reporting with agreed KPIs.

Out of scope:
1. Enterprise-scale rollout.
2. Replacement of existing recycling partners.
3. Any hazardous Grade X export pathway.

## risk_controls

- Grade X hazardous items remain in Canada.
- Chain-of-custody checkpoints are documented from intake to disposition.
- Legal and compliance statements are split into `VERIFIED_INTERNAL` controls and `HYPOTHESIS` items pending section-level citation confirmation.
- Pilot includes pre-defined stop conditions to prevent unmanaged escalation.

## what_we_need

From Best Buy, we request:

1. One Green Team stakeholder owner.
2. One Retail Operations stakeholder owner.
3. One Compliance/Legal or Finance stakeholder owner.
4. Limited discovery data: item category mix.
5. Limited discovery data: approximate collection volume for pilot scope.
6. Limited discovery data: current downstream process overview.
7. One decision-meeting sponsor to coordinate internal review.

## next_decision

Before the close of the presentation, we request agreement on:

1. Follow-up decision meeting date (within 7 business days).
2. Named stakeholder owners (minimum three functions).
3. Data packet owner and delivery date.

If these three commitments are confirmed, we will deliver a finalized citation-backed pilot packet and live risk register for that session.

## evidence_note

This one-pager follows the project rule that unsourced quantitative or legal claims are marked and not presented as facts until citation completion.
