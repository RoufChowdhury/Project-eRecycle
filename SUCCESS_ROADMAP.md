**Success Gate:** Every team member has a clear assignment with a deadline.

---

### Step 3: Deep Regulatory Research (Both Countries)
**⏰ Deadline: Feb 25**

> **Einstein:** *"The only source of knowledge is experience."*

This is the **intellectual foundation** of your entire project. Sloppy compliance = project death.

#### 🇨🇦 Canada — What You Must Know Cold

| Research Item | Owner | Source | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basel Convention 2025 amendments (PIC requirement) | Ian | [Canada Gazette](https://gazette.gc.ca), [HillNotes](https://hillnotes.ca) | 2-page summary |
| CEPA hazardous material export rules | Ian | [canada.ca](https://canada.ca) | Compliance checklist |
| Ontario RPRA (Resource Productivity & Recovery Authority) | Ian | [rpra.ca](https://rpra.ca) | Retailer obligations summary |
| Data destruction standards (NIST 800-88) | Ramzy | NIST publication | Process specification |
| Canadian export documentation requirements | Brandon | CBSA, freight forwarder consultation | Document checklist |

#### 🇳🇬 Nigeria — What Abdullahi Must Formalize

| Research Item | Owner | Source | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| NESREA importer registration process | Abdullahi | [nesrea.gov.ng](https://nesrea.gov.ng) | Step-by-step guide |
| UEEE functionality testing requirements | Abdullahi | NESREA guidelines | Testing protocol |
| Customs clearance at Lagos/Tin Can ports | Abdullahi | On-ground experience | Port procedures doc |
| EPRON (E-waste Producer Responsibility Org Nigeria) | Abdullahi | [EPRON](https://epron.org.ng) | Registration guide |
| Licensed NESREA recyclers for hazardous fraction | Abdullahi | NESREA database | Partner list |
| Nigerian Gazette requirements | Abdullahi | Govt Gazette (in your Drive) | Legal brief |

**Success Gate:** Complete regulatory compliance dossier for both countries.

---

## 🟡 PHASE B — BUILD THE MACHINE (Weeks 4-6, Mar 5 – Mar 25)

### Step 4: Build the Compliance Engine
**⏰ Deadline: Mar 10**

> **Musk:** *"I think the best way to attract great people is to have a clear sense of purpose."*

Turn your regulatory knowledge into an **operational system** — a repeatable, auditable compliance process.

**Deliverables:**

**4.1 — The Item Classification System**
Every device entering your pipeline gets classified:

| Classification | Criteria | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade A — Reusable** | Fully functional, cosmetically good, <5 years old | Export to Nigeria for resale |
| **Grade B — Repairable** | Minor issues, fixable with <$30 in parts | Refurbish in Nigeria, then resale |
| **Grade C — Parts Harvest** | Non-functional but has valuable components | Controlled disassembly in Nigeria |
| **Grade X — Hazardous** | Contains hazardous materials, batteries, ODS | **NEVER EXPORT** — Certified Canadian recycler |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Grade X items MUST stay in Canada.** Exporting hazardous e-waste to Nigeria is ILLEGAL under both Basel Convention and NESREA regulations. This is the line you never cross.

**4.2 — The Documentation Package (Per Shipment)**
Create a template package containing:
1. Basel Convention PIC permit (filed with Environment Canada)
2. UEEE Declaration — item-by-item manifest with serial numbers
3. Functionality test certificates (per item)
4. Data destruction certificates (NIST 800-88 compliant)
5. Cargo Movement Requirement (CMR) document
6. NESREA pre-shipment notification
7. Insurance certificate
8. Bill of lading
9. Importer liability declaration
10. Ownership transfer documentation

**4.3 — The Testing Protocol**
For every device:
- Power-on test ✓
- Core functionality test (screen, keyboard, ports, etc.) ✓
- Safety inspection (no damaged batteries, no leaking, no exposed wires) ✓
- Cosmetic assessment (Grade A/B/C classification) ✓
- Photo documentation (timestamped) ✓
- Serial number / model recording ✓

**Success Gate:** Complete compliance system that could pass an Environment Canada audit.

### Step 5: Design the Full Operations Blueprint
**⏰ Deadline: Mar 18**

> **Einstein:** *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."*

**5.1 — Canada-Side Operations**

**5.2 — Logistics Chain**

| Leg | Mode | Route | Est. Time | Key Partner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best Buy → Sorting Facility | Truck | Ottawa local | 1 day | Your team / contracted |
| Sorting → Testing → Packing | Warehouse | Ottawa facility | 3-5 days | Your team |
| Ottawa → Port of Montreal | Truck | Highway 417→40 | 1 day | Freight company |
| Montreal → Lagos (Tin Can Island) | Ocean freight | Atlantic | 21-28 days | Shipping line (MSC, Maersk, etc.) |
| Port clearance | — | Lagos | 5-10 days | Customs broker + Abdullahi's team |
| Port → Refurbishment facility | Truck | Lagos local | 1 day | Abdullahi's trusted network |

**5.3 — Nigeria-Side Operations**

**5.4 — Facility Requirements**

| Location | Need | Estimated Size | Est. Monthly Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ottawa sorting/testing** | Warehouse with power, tables, testing equipment | 2,000-3,000 sq ft | $2,000-4,000 CAD |
| **Lagos refurbishment** | Workshop with repair tools, spare parts inventory | 3,000-5,000 sq ft | Abdullahi to confirm |

> [!TIP]
> **Start lean:** For the pilot, you don't need a warehouse. A garage, university lab, or shared industrial space works for 1-2 containers.

**Success Gate:** Complete operations manual that any team member could follow.

---

### Step 6: Deliver the Pilot Proposal to Best Buy
**⏰ Deadline: Mar 25**

> **Musk:** *"People should pursue what they're passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else."*

This is where you **close the deal for the pilot**.

**The Pilot Proposal must contain:**

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Executive Summary** | 1 page — problem, solution, why now, why you |
| **The Framework** | Your enhanced flowchart + compliance engine |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Proof you understand Basel, CEPA, NESREA |
| **Pilot Scope** | 1 store, 3 months, specific categories |
| **What We Need from Best Buy** | Access to collected items, volume data, point of contact |
| **What Best Buy Gets** | Improved diversion rate, ESG data, compliance assurance, zero cost/risk |
| **Team Credentials** | Carleton MEng, Abdullahi's 7-year experience, team bios |
| **Timeline** | Week-by-week pilot schedule |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Insurance, compliance guarantees, data privacy assurance |

**Key Negotiation Points:**
- Ask for a **small, low-risk category** to start — e.g., laptops and desktops only (not batteries)
- Make it **zero-cost to Best Buy** for the pilot — you absorb costs, recoup through Nigeria-side sales
- Offer **full transparency** — weekly reports, photo documentation, tracking data
- Position it as a **university research project** first — lower perceived risk for them

**Success Gate:** Best Buy agrees to a pilot at one Ottawa-area store.

---

## 🔴 PHASE C — PROVE IT WORKS (Weeks 7-18, Mar 26 – Jul 15)

### Step 7: Run the Pilot — 1 Store, 3 Months
**⏰ Timeline: Apr 1 – Jun 30**

> **Einstein:** *"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not."*

**Month 1 (April) — Setup & First Collection**
- [ ] Finalize agreements with Best Buy (even informal/letter of intent)
- [ ] Set up sorting/testing facility in Ottawa
- [ ] Register with Environment Canada for Basel PIC permit
- [ ] Abdullahi registers with NESREA as importer
- [ ] Purchase basic testing equipment (multimeters, cables, monitors)
- [ ] First collection from Best Buy store
- [ ] Sort, test, certify, document
- [ ] Ship first container (target: 200-500 items)

**Month 2 (May) — Refine & Second Shipment**
- [ ] First container arrives in Nigeria — track clearance process
- [ ] Document every friction point and delay
- [ ] Refine testing/documentation process based on Month 1 learnings
- [ ] Second collection and shipment
- [ ] Begin refurbishment/sales of first batch in Nigeria

**Month 3 (June) — Prove & Report**
- [ ] Third shipment
- [ ] Compile pilot results: items processed, compliance rate, revenue generated
- [ ] Create **Pilot Results Report** for Best Buy
- [ ] Photography and video documentation of full chain
- [ ] Academic paper draft from pilot data

### Step 8: Measure & Prove Results
**⏰ Deadline: Jul 15**

**KPIs to Track:**

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Items collected | 500+ over 3 months | Volume viability |
| Compliance rate | 100% | Non-negotiable |
| Grade A/B ratio | >60% of items | Revenue viability |
| Grade X diversion | 100% to Canadian recycler | Legal requirement |
| Time: collection → Nigeria sale | <60 days | Operational efficiency |
| Revenue per item (avg) | >$50 CAD | Financial viability |
| Documentation accuracy | 100% | Audit-readiness |
| Customer satisfaction (Best Buy) | Positive feedback | Relationship health |

**The Proof Package for Best Buy:**
1. Executive summary of pilot results
2. Data dashboard — items by category, volumes, outcomes
3. Compliance audit trail — every document for every item
4. Financial summary — costs vs. revenue
5. Photos/video of the full chain (Canada → Nigeria)
6. Testimonials from Nigeria-side buyers
7. Environmental impact calculation (kg diverted from landfill, CO₂ saved)

**Success Gate:** Quantified proof that the model works — compliant, economically viable, scalable.

---

## 🟣 PHASE D — SCALE (Months 5-12)

### Step 9: Scale Across Ontario
**⏰ Timeline: Jul – Oct**

With proven pilot data:
- Propose expansion to **10-25 Best Buy stores** in Ottawa/GTA
- Negotiate a **formal partnership agreement** (not just letter of intent)
- Hire 2-3 part-time staff for sorting/testing
- Upgrade to a proper warehouse facility
- Establish monthly container shipping cadence

### Step 10: Expand Product Categories
**⏰ Timeline: Sep – Dec**

- Start with safe categories (laptops, desktops, monitors)
- Add phones, tablets, small appliances
- Add TVs (larger logistics challenge)
- **Never add batteries or hazardous items** to the export stream — keep those domestic

### Step 11: National Scale & New Clients
**⏰ Timeline: Year 2**

- Expand beyond Best Buy — approach **Staples, The Source, London Drugs, Walmart**
- Expand beyond Ontario — **BC, Alberta, Quebec** (each has different EPR rules)
- Consider **Nigeria → other West African markets** (Ghana, Senegal, Kenya)

### Step 12: Industry Standard Framework
**⏰ Timeline: Year 2-3**

> **Einstein:** *"Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value."*

- Publish your framework as a **white paper / industry standard**
- Present at conferences (e.g., International E-Waste Management Network)
- License the compliance engine to other companies
- Become the **gold standard** for Canada-Africa UEEE value chains

## 💰 Financial Projection (Conservative Estimate)

### Pilot Phase (3 months)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Startup costs (testing equipment, facility) | -$5,000 CAD |
| Shipping (1 container × 3) | -$9,000 CAD |
| Compliance/documentation | -$2,000 CAD |
| Revenue from 300 refurbished devices @ $100 avg | +$30,000 CAD |
| Revenue from parts recovery | +$3,000 CAD |
| **Net pilot profit (est.)** | **+$17,000 CAD** |

### Year 1 (After Scaling to 10 Stores)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Monthly volume: ~500 items | — |
| Annual revenue (refurbishment + parts) | ~$400,000 CAD |
| Annual costs (facility, staff, shipping, compliance) | ~$250,000 CAD |
| **Net annual profit (est.)** | **~$150,000 CAD** |

> [!NOTE]
> These are conservative estimates. Actual numbers depend on item mix, Nigeria market prices, and shipping costs. Your financial model (Brandon's deliverable) must refine these with real quotes.
