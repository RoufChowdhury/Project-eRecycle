# Best Buy Team Brief - eRecycle Decision Memo

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Purpose:** Team-aligned narrative before external stakeholder follow-up  
**Decision question:** Do we proceed to a bounded pilot design review?

## 1) Business Decision in One Line

This is a strong opportunity **if we position eRecycle as a compliance-and-traceability evidence layer**, not as a recycler replacement or immediate scale business.

## 2) The Real Problem We Solve

Best Buy already has working recycling channels. The unresolved management problem is evidence quality:

1. Can we prove item-level traceability from customer drop-off to documented final disposition?
2. Can we provide defensible documentation when cross-border controlled movement may apply?
3. Can Green Team and leadership use higher-confidence data in sustainability and compliance discussions?

This is primarily a governance/documentation problem, not a collection-volume problem.

## 3) Verified Facts We Can Stand Behind Today

1. **Basel control scope changed and is active:** The Basel e-waste amendments (including entries A1181 and Y49) entered into force on **January 1, 2025**.

2. **Ontario current benchmark data exists:** RPRA reports (page updated **January 30, 2026**) show electronics recovery requirement at **65%**, actual recovery at **66%**, with **41,579 tonnes** recovered.

3. **Best Buy has explicit environmental commitments:** Best Buy Canada states a **75% operational emissions reduction** path, **carbon neutral by 2040**, and **20% customer emissions reduction by 2030**.

4. **Best Buy recycling/data handling policy is explicit:** Customers are expected to remove personal data before recycling, Geek Squad support may involve charges, and Best Buy is not liable for data left on devices.

5. **Canada permit requirement is explicit where controlled materials apply:** Exporters/importers must submit permit applications to ECCC before shipping controlled cross-border waste/recyclables.

## 4) Why Best Buy Could Need This

1. It strengthens decision-quality evidence with bounded operational disruption.
2. It aligns with existing sustainability commitments instead of creating a new strategic track.
3. It improves traceability posture without displacing current recycling partners.

## 5) What We Are Not Proposing

1. We are not proposing immediate broad export/resale scale.
2. We are not proposing partner replacement.
3. We are not presenting unsourced legal or financial claims as facts.

## 6) Proposed Pilot (Bounded and Reversible)

1. Scope: 1 store, 3 months, limited categories.
2. Model: parallel pilot with current system.
3. Controls:
- Pre-launch evidence gate
- Weekly exception/risk gate
- Stop condition gate if control breach appears

## 7) Go / Hold / No-Go Rubric

### Go

1. Legal/compliance owners are assigned.
2. Claims are tagged as `VERIFIED` or `HYPOTHESIS`.
3. Store operations burden is accepted.
4. Weekly KPI/report template is approved.

### Hold

1. Critical legal citations are incomplete.
2. Data access or ownership is unclear.
3. Scope is not bounded enough.

### No-Go

1. Narrative implies partner replacement.
2. Decision case depends on unsourced claims.
3. Stop conditions are undefined.

## 8) Team Ask This Week

Approve a **30-minute decision meeting** with Green Team + Operations + Compliance/Legal (or Finance) to decide one outcome: `Go`, `Hold`, or `No-Go`.
