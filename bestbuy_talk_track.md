# Best Buy Management Talk Track

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Audience:** Mixed decision group (Green Team, Retail Operations, Compliance/Legal or Finance)  
**Format:** 30-minute presentation + Q&A  
**Primary objective:** Secure a formal follow-up decision meeting within 7 business days and obtain limited pilot discovery data.

## Evidence Discipline

- `VERIFIED_INTERNAL`: Traceable to current Project eRecycle documents.
- `HYPOTHESIS`: Plausible but not yet externally validated with primary sources.
- `DO_NOT_CLAIM_YET`: Not presentation-safe as a fact until citation package is complete.

## 30-Minute Script (Risk-to-Value)

| Time | Segment | Key sentence | Evidence tag | Ask |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `00:00-01:30` | Opening frame | "This is a low-risk compliance and traceability pilot, not a replacement of your current partners." | `E-02` | Confirm this framing matches current priorities. |
| `01:30-04:00` | Current risk/visibility gap | "Today we are solving a management visibility and control gap after collection, not redesigning your core retail model." | `E-01`, `E-02` | Confirm the problem statement owner on your side. |
| `04:00-06:30` | Compliance reality | "Our operating rule is simple: if a claim or control is not evidenced, we treat it as hypothesis and do not operationalize it." | `E-08`, `E-03`, `H-01` | Assign compliance/legal reviewer for the follow-up meeting. |
| `06:30-09:30` | Controlled pilot proposal | "We propose a bounded pilot: one store, three months, constrained categories, and clear stop/go gates." | `E-04` | Confirm willingness to evaluate this bounded pilot format. |
| `09:30-12:30` | Flow of custody | "Every item follows a documented chain from intake to final disposition, with hazardous items retained in Canada." | `E-03` | Confirm required audit artifacts from your compliance team. |
| `12:30-15:00` | Risk register + controls | "We pre-map legal, reputation, operational, and data risks and pair each risk with a named control owner." | `E-08` | Nominate one owner each from Ops and Compliance/Legal. |
| `15:00-17:00` | KPI dashboard | "Pilot proof will be measured through compliance completeness, cycle-time visibility, and documented outcomes." | `E-04`, `H-02` | Confirm top 3 KPIs you want reviewed weekly. |
| `17:00-19:00` | Team credibility | "Execution is led by defined roles across liaison, operations, and compliance functions." | `E-07` | Confirm who your counterpart owners should be. |
| `19:00-21:00` | Give/Get exchange | "You provide controlled access and data; we provide traceability, compliance discipline, and transparent reporting." | `E-05`, `E-06` | Validate this exchange as fair and practical. |
| `21:00-23:00` | Pilot boundaries | "In scope and out of scope are explicit, so you control exposure and can stop without disruption." | `E-04`, `E-02` | Confirm no-go categories before pilot design. |
| `23:00-25:00` | 30-60-90 day path | "The first 90 days are designed to generate decision-grade evidence, not scale prematurely." | `E-04`, `H-02` | Confirm decision checkpoints and review cadence. |
| `25:00-30:00` | Close + commitment | "If this risk posture is acceptable, we request a formal decision meeting within 7 business days with named owners." | `E-05`, `E-06` | Lock date, participants, and data packet owner before close. |

## 15-Minute Fallback Version

If the meeting is shortened, use slides `1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12` only:

1. Problem and decision ask.
2. Bounded pilot design.
3. Risk controls and ownership.
4. Give/Get exchange.
5. Final commitment request.

## Q&A Guardrails

- If asked for specific legal section citations not yet packeted: respond with `HYPOTHESIS`, then commit exact follow-up owner/date.
- If asked for financial outcome ranges: present method first, numbers second, and label estimates `HYPOTHESIS`.
- If challenged on partner overlap: reaffirm complementary model (`E-02`) and controlled pilot boundary (`E-04`).
