## The Problem (Why This Exists)

Every year, Ontario alone recovers [41,579 tonnes of electronics](https://rpra.ca/public-reports/resource-recovery-reports/supply-and-recovery-of-electronics-in-ontario/) through regulated take-back programs — barely meeting the [65% recovery rate requirement](https://rpra.ca/public-reports/resource-recovery-reports/supply-and-recovery-of-electronics-in-ontario/) at 66% actual. Much of what gets "recovered" is shredded for low-value commodity metals. Functional devices worth $150–400 in emerging markets are destroyed for $2–5 in scrap.

Meanwhile, Best Buy Canada — one of the largest electronics collection points — faces three unresolved gaps:

1. **No post-handoff visibility.** Once items go to recycling partners (EPRA/ARMA), Best Buy has zero item-level tracking. No chain-of-custody. No proof of proper handling.

2. **No data destruction accountability.** Best Buy's own [recycling policy](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/help/haul-away-and-recycling/battery-and-electronic-recycling-program) states customers must remove personal data themselves, and Best Buy is not liable for data left on devices. There is no certified data sanitization in the current recycling flow.

3. **New regulatory exposure.** The [Basel Convention e-waste amendments](https://www.basel.int/Implementation/Ewaste/EwasteAmendments/EwasteAmendmentsFAQs/tabid/10107/Default.aspx) entered into force on **January 1, 2025**, expanding Prior Informed Consent requirements to ALL e-waste exports (entries A1181 and Y49). [ECCC requires permit applications before shipping](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-reducing-waste/cross-border-regulations.html) any controlled cross-border waste. If downstream partners export improperly, the reputational risk flows uphill to Best Buy.

## Our Solution

eRecycle is a **compliance-first framework** that creates an auditable chain-of-custody from customer drop-off to verified final disposition — while redirecting reusable electronics to Nigeria's refurbishment market instead of the shredder.

**How it works:**

| Step | What Happens | Compliance Layer |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Collect** | Receive items from Best Buy's existing take-back program | Item-level intake documentation |
| **Grade** | Sort into A (reusable), B (repairable), C (parts), X (hazardous) | Standardized grading criteria |
| **Sanitize** | NIST 800-88 data destruction (Clear/Purge/Destroy) with certificates | Per-device destruction certificate |
| **Export A/B/C** | Ship compliant items to Nigeria with full Basel PIC documentation | ECCC permit + NESREA importer registration |
| **Contain X** | Hazardous items NEVER leave Canada — routed to certified recyclers | Grade X is a non-negotiable rule |
| **Document** | Full audit trail from drop-off to final disposition | Available to Best Buy for ESG reporting |

## Why Best Buy Needs This Now

Best Buy has publicly committed to [75% operational emissions reduction, carbon neutrality by 2040, and 20% customer emissions reduction by 2030](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/about/commitment-to-environment/blt6cddfa55b0e75186). Those commitments require verifiable data. Right now, Best Buy cannot prove what happens to collected electronics after handoff. eRecycle provides the documentation layer that makes those commitments auditable.

## The Pilot (Bounded, Reversible, Zero Cost to Best Buy)

- **Scope:** 1 Ottawa-area store, 3 months, laptops/desktops only
- **Model:** Runs parallel to existing recycling — no partner replacement
- **Cost to Best Buy:** Zero. eRecycle absorbs all operational costs.
- **Revenue model:** eRecycle recoups through Nigeria-side refurbished device sales
- **Stop conditions:** Pilot pauses immediately if any control breach is detected
- **Deliverables:** Weekly KPI reports, full chain-of-custody data, Grade X containment proof
